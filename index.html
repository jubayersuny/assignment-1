            Dr. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is known as the "Father of Microfinance" for his groundbreaking work in poverty alleviation and economic empowerment. Here is one of his inspiring quotes:

"We are not job seekers; we are job creators."

This reflects his belief in empowering individuals through microcredit and fostering entrepreneurship to break the cycle of poverty. If you'd like, I can provide more insights into his work or philosophies.
